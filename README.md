# accessmodifier
Create a console project for an vehicle lot to chart information about their inventory. To accomplish this, you will need to create the following:

    Create a class named Vehicle

    Create a class named Car that extends Vehicle

    Create a class named Semi that extends Vehicle

    Make all members on the Vehicle class accessed only by a subclass.

    Car and Semi can be accessed from outside of the assembly.

    Note: Try to map these classes to the real world objects as best as you can. Decided for yourselves what members should exist on each class and the correct data type.
